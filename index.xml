      <description>Welcome to the M68 Project  M68 aims to integrate students with the research culture with organizations and people in academia globally.
 We are a group of students on a mission to build the biggest network of decentralised knowledge base of resources/opportunities/people with the purpose of leveraging it to advance the state of Mankind&amp;rsquo;s Consciousness. We bring together people from all walks of life, working on all fields of science/tech/artcommerce, and augmenting them with the tools and possibilites to make the impossible, possible.</description>
